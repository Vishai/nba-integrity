# NBA Stewardship Reform Plan

## A Framework for Competitive Integrity Through Positive Incentive Architecture

**Version:** 1.0 — Phase 1 Working Draft **Author:** Brandon Armstrong **Status:** In Development

---

## Preamble

This document presents a comprehensive reform framework designed to address the NBA's persistent tanking problem — not through punitive restriction, but through layered positive incentives that reward competitive integrity while preserving legitimate rebuilding pathways.

Unlike proposals currently under consideration by the league (pick protection limits, consecutive top-four restrictions, March 1 lottery locks, or lottery tournaments), this framework introduces a dual-system architecture that measures and rewards ethical organizational behavior rather than simply adding blunt constraints to existing mechanisms.

### Calibration Philosophy

All numerical thresholds, weightings, and scoring ranges presented in this document are **proposed starting points** subject to empirical backtesting against historical NBA data. The framework is designed to be tuned, not frozen.

**Key principles:**

- Thresholds should be reviewed and recalibrated annually by the TII Review Board.
- The NBA's own historical data (minimum 15 seasons) should be used to establish statistical baselines before any flags or consequences are activated.
- A **2-year observation period** is recommended before consequences attach, allowing the system to be validated in a live environment without penalizing any franchise during calibration.
- Any stakeholder challenging a specific numerical threshold ("why 1.5 standard deviations and not 1.3?") should understand that the value of this framework lies in its **architecture and methodology**, not in any single calibration point. Numbers are starting positions; the system is designed to learn and adjust.

---

## I. Core Philosophy

The NBA's competitive integrity crisis is not a player problem — it is an organizational incentive problem. The current system creates a binary landscape: compete or tank. There is virtually no structural reward for a non-contending team to field its best possible lineup every night.

This framework is built on five principles:

1. **Protect legitimate rebuilding.** Teams that are genuinely bad deserve access to top draft talent. Nothing in this framework punishes losing — it targets the _manner_ of losing.
    
2. **Eliminate incentives for intentional losing.** When organizations manipulate rosters, rotations, and player availability to manufacture losses, it undermines the competitive product and erodes fan trust.
    
3. **Preserve organically built dynasties.** Teams that develop talent through the draft and retain homegrown players should be rewarded, not restricted.
    
4. **Discourage artificial superteam compression.** The framework incentivizes patient roster construction over free-agent aggregation.
    
5. **Align franchise behavior with long-term league health.** Every team, regardless of competitive position, should have structural reasons to put its best product on the floor every night.
    

### The Organizational Accountability Principle

This framework explicitly targets **organizational behavior** — front office decisions, coaching deployment patterns, and roster management strategy — rather than individual player effort.

Players have every incentive to perform at their highest level: future contract value, legacy considerations, competitive pride, and peer reputation. The manipulation that constitutes tanking almost always occurs at the organizational level through:

- Sitting healthy players capable of competing (organizational/medical staff decision)
- Deploying suboptimal lineups in competitive game states (coaching/front office decision)
- Artificially limiting minutes of productive players (coaching decision)
- Engineering behavioral patterns after roster changes designed to maximize losses rather than develop remaining talent (organizational strategy)

No component of this framework measures or penalizes individual player performance. The system is designed to detect organizational patterns, not to question whether a player is "trying hard enough."

### The CBA Acknowledgment: Rebuilding as Structural Necessity

This framework recognizes a fundamental truth that most anti-tanking proposals ignore: **the NBA's salary cap structure often forces rebuilding behavior.** Teams do not always choose to be bad. The CBA's rigid cap, luxury tax penalties, max contract structures, and restricted free agency rules regularly leave franchises with no viable competitive path forward. When a team is paying $25 million to a veteran on a roster winning 18 games, trading that player for future draft capital and cap relief is not tanking — it is responsible asset management.

Mid-season veteran trades are a normal, healthy part of the NBA's ecosystem. They serve multiple legitimate purposes:

- **Cap rehabilitation:** Escaping bad contracts that block roster flexibility
- **Honest competitive assessment:** Acknowledging that a roster isn't a contender and pivoting toward the future rather than running in place
- **Player welfare:** Moving productive veterans to contending teams where they can compete for championships rather than languishing on lottery rosters
- **Draft capital accumulation:** Building the future asset base that enables the next competitive cycle

The Stewardship Reform Plan does not penalize any of these transactions. The TII does not flag roster turnover or deadline trades. What the TII measures is **what an organization does with the players it still has** after any trades occur.

Consider the distinction:

**Team A** trades two veterans at the deadline, then continues playing its remaining roster competitively — running real rotations, keeping available players on the floor, competing in close games. The NRCI's roster continuity adjustment accounts for the talent loss from the trade. The RIS measures deployment patterns of the remaining roster against their own pre-trade baseline. Team A's TII remains clean.

**Team B** trades two veterans at the deadline, and then _also_ starts sitting healthy remaining players, inverting rotation quality in close games, and engineering fourth-quarter collapses with lineup combinations designed to lose. The trade itself is fine. The behavioral pattern surrounding it is the problem.

The trade is not the sin. The behavioral pattern after it can be.

This distinction is one of the framework's most important advantages over current NBA proposals. The league currently fines teams and publicly shames them for resting players, but has no mechanism to distinguish between a franchise legitimately managing a rebuild and one gaming the system. This framework does.

More broadly, the Stewardship Reform Plan acknowledges that **tanking is a rational response to structural incentives.** The draft is the only reliable path to star-level talent for small-market or cap-strapped franchises. Free agency favors large markets. The CBA creates conditions where intentional losing is economically rational. This framework does not blame organizations for responding rationally to bad incentives — it changes the incentive architecture so that rational behavior and competitive integrity align.

## II. Dual-System Structure

The reform operates through two parallel systems:

### A. Standard NBA Draft (Unchanged)

The existing draft lottery remains intact. The worst teams retain the strongest odds for top selections. Legitimate rebuilding is not punished. This is critical for stakeholder buy-in — the framework adds a layer; it does not replace the foundation.

### B. Stewardship Supplemental Lottery (SSL)

An annual supplemental process that rewards franchises demonstrating competitive integrity. The SSL creates a positive incentive layer that sits alongside the existing draft, offering meaningful assets to teams that earn Stewardship Points (SP) through ethical organizational behavior.

**SSL Eligibility:** Only teams meeting SP thresholds qualify.

**SSL Awards:**

- Draft-linked supplemental assets (additional second-round selections, draft swap rights)
- Cap elasticity credits (defined flexibility in luxury tax or salary cap calculations)
- Trade flexibility enhancements (expanded trade exception windows, relaxed matching salary requirements for qualifying transactions)

**SSL Lottery Mechanics:**

- Odds weighted by SP accumulation
- Diminishing returns applied to prevent runaway advantages for perennial high-SP teams
- Separate lottery event conducted annually following the Standard Draft

_[Note: Detailed SSL prize structure, cap elasticity credit mechanics, and trade flexibility specifications to be developed in Phase 1 expansion.]_

---

## III. Stewardship Points (SP) Scoring Rubric

Stewardship Points are the currency of the SSL system. Teams accumulate SP across five categories, measured over a rolling evaluation window.

### SP Categories

**1. Star Availability Compliance** Teams earn SP for making their best available players genuinely available in competitive game contexts. Verified through independent medical review (a mechanism the NBA already employs — see Section VI).

**2. Net Rating Improvement Year-Over-Year** Teams earn SP for demonstrating genuine on-court improvement relative to their own baseline, adjusted for roster changes and strength of schedule.

**3. Rotation Integrity** Teams earn SP for maintaining consistent rotation patterns throughout the season, particularly in the post-All-Star-break period when tanking incentives intensify.

**4. Cap Discipline and Homegrown Player Retention** Teams earn SP for retaining draft picks and developed talent. Signing homegrown players to extensions generates SP. However, the framework recognizes that cap constraints sometimes force even homegrown player movement — this category measures _patterns_ of retention and development culture, not individual transactions. A team that consistently develops and extends its own talent earns more SP than one that routinely trades drafted players for short-term cap relief, but no single transaction is penalized in isolation.

**5. Competitive Engagement in Non-Playoff Contexts** Teams eliminated from playoff contention earn SP for maintaining competitive effort metrics (close-game performance, late-game lineup quality, post-elimination win rate relative to pre-elimination).

### SP Decay Mechanism

Points operate on a **rolling three-year half-life**. Current-season SP are counted at full value; prior-season SP at 50%; two-seasons-prior SP at 25%. This prevents teams from "banking" integrity points during one season and cashing them in while tanking the next.

_[Note: Specific point values per category, weighting, and threshold calculations to be developed in Phase 1 expansion.]_

---

## IV. Tanking Integrity Index (TII)

The Tanking Integrity Index is the detection and measurement engine of the framework. It identifies organizational behaviors consistent with intentional losing and produces a composite score that determines a team's exposure to the Emerging Talent Pool mechanism.

### Design Principles

The TII is designed to distinguish between three fundamentally different organizational states:

1. **Legitimate rebuilding:** A young, developing team losing games because they lack talent. This team plays its best available players, runs competitive rotations, and loses because better teams beat them. _The TII should not flag this team._
    
2. **Strategic manipulation:** An organization that possesses competitive-level talent but deliberately suppresses it — sitting healthy players, deploying anti-competitive lineups, engineering late-season collapses. _The TII should flag this team._
    
3. **Contextual performance variation:** A team experiencing natural win-loss fluctuations due to schedule difficulty, injury timing, roster turnover, or the normal ebb and flow of a long season. _The TII should not flag this team._
    

The critical challenge is separating category 2 from categories 1 and 3 with sufficient accuracy to withstand both statistical scrutiny and public credibility challenges.

---

### Component 1: Star Availability Score (SAS)

**Weight: 30% of composite TII**

The Star Availability Score measures whether organizations are sitting healthy, productive players in competitive game contexts — the single most visible and publicly damaging form of tanking behavior.

#### Data Inputs

- Games missed by players averaging 25+ minutes per game during the current season
- Independent medical panel verification of injury status (mechanism already exists within the NBA's Player Participation Policy)
- Game context at time of absence: score differential at tip-off (based on spread), current standings implications, and whether the game had competitive significance
- Player's recent game load and back-to-back scheduling

#### Scoring Methodology

- **Baseline establishment:** Calculate league-average games missed by qualified rotation players (25+ min/game), adjusted for team age profile. Younger rosters naturally experience fewer soft-tissue injuries; veteran-heavy rosters have legitimate load management needs.
- **Flag trigger:** A team's star absences exceed **1.5 standard deviations** above the age-adjusted baseline AND absences cluster disproportionately in games with competitive implications (games within 3 games of a standings tiebreaker, nationally televised games, or games against direct standings competitors).
- **Severity multiplier:** Absences in games where the team entered within 5 points at the half are weighted 1.5x compared to absences in projected blowouts (15+ point spread).

#### Exclusions

- Players on season-ending injury lists verified by the independent medical panel are fully excluded.
- Scheduled rest days that comply with the NBA's existing Player Participation Policy are excluded.
- Post-elimination rest for players with documented chronic conditions (verified independently) is excluded.

#### Current Precedent

The NBA already employs this exact mechanism. The league's investigation of the Indiana Pacers' February 2025 violations included an independent medical review that concluded Pascal Siakam and two other starters would have been eligible to play under the league's medical criteria. The SAS formalizes and systematizes what the NBA is already doing on an ad hoc basis.

---

### Component 2: Net Rating Collapse Index (NRCI)

**Weight: 25% of composite TII**

The NRCI detects statistically anomalous performance drops that cannot be explained by roster changes, schedule difficulty, or normal variance — the analytical fingerprint of organizational tanking.

#### Data Inputs

- Rolling 15-game net rating windows across the full season
- Roster continuity percentage (accounts for trades, injuries, and call-ups)
- Strength of schedule during each evaluation window
- Fourth-quarter net rating specifically (the period where game-manipulation is most impactful and visible)

#### Strength of Schedule Normalization Layer

Raw net rating collapse is an unreliable indicator. A team that posts strong numbers against a soft stretch and then regresses against elite opponents is not tanking — they are experiencing normal schedule-driven variance.

The NRCI addresses this through **expected performance residual analysis:**

1. For each game, calculate the team's **expected net rating** based on opponent offensive and defensive efficiency ratings.
2. Measure the **residual** — the gap between actual performance and expected performance against that specific opponent.
3. Only flag teams when the residual is consistently and significantly negative beyond thresholds, not when the raw net rating drops.

This normalization ensures that:

- A team whose net rating was inflated by a cupcake stretch and then normalizes against better opponents will **not** be flagged, because expected performance adjusts with opponent quality.
- A team that underperforms relative to what their roster _should_ do against the teams they're actually playing **will** be flagged.

#### Momentum Decay Acknowledgment

Teams — particularly young rosters — coming off hot streaks against weaker opponents often experience natural regression as schedule difficulty increases. This is not manipulation; it is a well-documented statistical phenomenon.

The NRCI incorporates a **10-game rolling adjustment window** that smooths transitions between schedule difficulty phases. Short-term regression following an "easy" stretch is expected and accounted for. Only sustained, schedule-adjusted underperformance triggers flags.

#### Post-Trade Recalibration Window

When a team makes roster changes at or near the trade deadline, the NRCI automatically recalibrates its expected performance baseline. This is critical to preventing false positives against teams engaged in legitimate rebuilding transactions.

The mechanism works as follows:

1. **Roster talent composite recalculation:** Within 48 hours of any trade, the NRCI recalculates the team's expected performance using only the players remaining on the roster. If a team trades a player contributing +3.0 EPM, the expected net rating drops accordingly.
2. **Integration grace period:** A **5-game adjustment window** follows any significant roster change (defined as losing 15%+ of cumulative roster impact metric via trade). During this window, performance is tracked but not scored — acknowledging that lineup integration, rotation restructuring, and chemistry rebuilding take time.
3. **New baseline activation:** After the grace period, the NRCI measures the team's performance against the _recalibrated_ expectation — not the pre-trade baseline. A team that traded its best player and now loses more games is performing as expected. A team that traded its best player and then _also_ collapses beyond what the talent loss would predict is exhibiting a pattern worth examining.

This ensures that **the act of trading a veteran never triggers the NRCI.** Only the behavioral pattern of the remaining roster — measured against a fair, recalibrated expectation — can generate flags.

#### Scoring Methodology

- Calculate expected net rating per game based on roster talent composite (using publicly available player impact metrics such as EPM, RAPTOR, or equivalent).
- **Flag trigger:** Actual net rating falls below expected by more than **4.0 points** for **15+ consecutive games**, with no corresponding roster talent loss exceeding **30%** (as measured by cumulative player impact metric of players lost via trade/injury versus those remaining).
- **Critical flag:** Fourth-quarter net rating drops more than **6.0 points** below the team's season average in games where the team was within 10 points entering the fourth quarter.

#### Historical Anchor

The Portland Trail Blazers' 2022-23 season provides a clear case study. Portland was 32-40 in March 2023, then lost nine of their final ten games. Federal investigators later revealed that insider information about player availability was being communicated to bettors during this stretch. The NRCI's residual analysis, applied retroactively, would clearly flag this pattern: the roster talent did not change, the schedule did not become dramatically harder, and the collapse was concentrated in the final weeks.

---

### Component 3: Rotation Integrity Score (RIS)

**Weight: 25% of composite TII**

The RIS measures whether coaching staffs are deploying lineups designed to compete or lineups designed to lose — particularly in competitive game states during the latter portion of the season.

#### Data Inputs

- Minutes distribution variance comparing pre-elimination and post-elimination deployment patterns
- Lineup net rating versus deployment frequency (are negative-net-rating lineups receiving increased minutes in close games?)
- Starter designation consistency across the season
- DNP-CD (Did Not Play — Coach's Decision) frequency for established rotation players post-elimination
- Substitution timing in competitive fourth quarters

#### Scoring Methodology

- **Baseline establishment:** Each team's minutes distribution pattern from their first 50 games establishes the baseline. This accounts for team-specific coaching philosophy and development priorities.
- **Flag trigger:** Post-elimination minutes correlation with player quality **inverts** — meaning lower-impact players receive disproportionately more minutes in close-game contexts than they did in the team's own first-50-game baseline.
- **Severity weighting:** Rotation changes in blowout game states (20+ point differential) are weighted minimally. Rotation changes in competitive game states (within 10 points in the fourth quarter) are weighted at full value.

#### Illustrative Case

The Utah Jazz's February 2025 behavior provides a clear example. Utah pulled Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson Jr. before the fourth quarter of tight games. In one instance, Utah entered the fourth quarter leading 94–87 against the Orlando Magic and still lost 120–117 after removing their best players. The RIS would detect this pattern clearly: positive-impact players removed from competitive game states, replaced by lower-impact players, in a pattern inconsistent with the team's own earlier-season rotation behavior.

---

### Component 4: Bottom-Tier Clustering Analysis (BTCA)

**Weight: 20% of composite TII**

The BTCA operates at the macro level, identifying when multiple teams are simultaneously racing to the bottom in ways that exceed historical norms — an indicator that league-wide tanking incentives are distorting competition.

#### Data Inputs

- Win pace of bottom 6 teams versus historical averages (20-season baseline)
- Pace of losing acceleration: rate of change in win percentage as the season progresses
- Correlation between team loss streaks and draft-relevant calendar dates (trade deadline, All-Star break, elimination dates)

#### Scoring Methodology

- **Historical baseline:** Calculate the average win total of the bottom 6 teams across the previous 20 seasons. Establish standard deviation bands.
- **League-wide flag:** Activates when **4+ teams** are simultaneously on pace to win fewer than **22 games** — a level of bottom-clustering that exceeds historical norms by a significant margin.
- **Individual team flag:** Activates when a team's post-All-Star-break win percentage drops below **50% of their pre-break rate** without corresponding roster talent loss exceeding **30%**.

#### Current Relevance

The 2025-26 season illustrates the need for this metric. Multiple teams — including the Washington Wizards, Indiana Pacers, and Sacramento Kings — are all on pace to win fewer than 20 games, a historically unusual concentration of extreme losing.

---

### TII Composite Scoring

Each component produces a score from 0 to 100. The composite TII is the weighted average:

**TII = (SAS × 0.30) + (NRCI × 0.25) + (RIS × 0.25) + (BTCA × 0.20)**

#### Classification Tiers

|TII Range|Classification|SSL Eligibility|Lottery Penalty|BTCA Contribution|Additional Consequence|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0–25|**Green** (Clean)|Full|None — receives redistributed combinations (share depends on ETP tier)|None|Eligible to receive ETP supplemental picks|
|26–50|**Yellow** (Watch)|Reduced|None|Counted toward threshold|Public reporting|
|51–75|**Orange** (Flagged)|Ineligible|Combination reduction + position displacement|Counted toward threshold; forfeitures feed ETP pool|Public reporting + review|
|76–100|**Red** (Violation)|Ineligible|Maximum reduction + displacement; forfeitures feed ETP pool|Counted toward threshold; may escalate ETP tier|Public reporting + fine consideration|

#### Dual Penalty Mechanics

The framework applies **two simultaneous lottery penalties** to Orange- and Red-classified teams. Both penalties apply regardless of lottery position, but their relative impact varies by where a team sits in the draft order.

**Penalty 1: Lottery Combination Reduction**

Flagged teams forfeit a percentage of their assigned lottery combinations:

|Classification|Combination Reduction|
|---|---|
|Green|0% — and receives proportional share of forfeited combinations from penalized teams|
|Yellow|0%|
|Orange|15% of assigned combinations|
|Red|30% of assigned combinations|

_Example: A worst-record Red team drops from 140 to 98 combinations (14.0% → 9.8%), making their odds equivalent to approximately the 6th-worst team despite having the worst record. A 10th-worst Orange team drops from 30 to 26 combinations (3.0% → 2.6%)._

**Forfeited Combination Redistribution:** Combinations forfeited by penalized teams are split between two destinations depending on whether the Emerging Talent Pool (Section V) is active:

- **ETP dormant (normal conditions):** 100% of forfeited combinations redistribute proportionally among Green-classified lottery teams.
- **ETP active:** A percentage of forfeited combinations is allocated to the ETP's own lottery pool (see Section V for tier-based allocation rates), with the remainder redistributing to Green teams.

In either case, Green-classified teams receive a direct, tangible reward for organizational integrity — your odds improve because a competitor chose to tank and you didn't.

**Penalty 2: Static Position Displacement**

Lottery picks 5–14 are assigned by reverse order of record (no randomness). Flagged teams are displaced downward in this static assignment:

|Classification|Position Displacement|
|---|---|
|Green|No displacement|
|Yellow|No displacement|
|Orange|Displaced **1 position** downward|
|Red|Displaced **2 positions** downward|

_Example: An 11th-worst team classified Red would pick 13th instead of 11th if they don't land in the top 4 via the lottery drawing. The teams at 12th and 13th move up one position each to fill the gap._

**Why both penalties apply simultaneously:** For teams near the top of the lottery (positions 1–5), combination reduction is the primary deterrent — losing 30% of 140 combinations is devastating. For teams at the outer edges (positions 10–14), combination reduction is nearly meaningless (30% of 15 combinations is 4–5 combinations), but dropping 2 pick positions is a concrete, visible penalty. By applying both, no lottery position is a "safe" place to tank from.

**Position Displacement Floor:** No team can be displaced below the 14th pick through this mechanism. If multiple displaced teams would stack at the bottom, they are ordered by TII score (higher TII = lower pick).

**BTCA Contribution:** Every Orange or Red classification — regardless of lottery position — counts toward the BTCA's league-wide threshold. A deliberate tank job by the 11th-worst team adds exactly as much systemic pressure toward ETP activation as one by the worst team. This prevents outer-edge teams from treating their TII classification as consequence-free.

---

### Late-Career Transition Monitoring (Supplemental Sub-Metric)

While individual player effort manipulation is extremely rare — players have overwhelming personal incentive to perform — one narrow edge case warrants structural acknowledgment: veteran players in the twilight of their careers who may have been offered post-playing roles (scouting, coaching, front office) by their current organization.

#### Mechanism

- **Post-Career Transition Disclosure Rule:** If a player retires and joins the same organization's staff within 18 months of their final playing season, the league retroactively reviews that player's final-season performance metrics against their established career-age decline curves.
- **Late-Career Performance Anomaly Flag:** If a player in their final 1–2 contract years shows statistical decline significantly beyond age-curve projections, and subsequently joins the organization in a non-playing capacity, this data point feeds into the team's TII as a minor contributory factor.
- This is **not dispositive** on its own and cannot independently move a team's TII classification. It exists as a contributing signal within the broader analysis.

#### Proportionality Note

This scenario is low-probability — perhaps occurring once every several years. The mechanism exists primarily as a deterrent through scrutiny risk rather than as a primary detection tool. Its inclusion demonstrates the framework's thoroughness without overstating the frequency or severity of the risk.

---

### TII Governance & Administration

#### TII Review Board

Composition:

- 3 independent statisticians (not employed by or consulting for any NBA franchise)
- 2 former NBA General Managers (minimum 5 years removed from active front office roles)
- 1 NBPA (National Basketball Players Association) representative

#### Transparency Mechanisms

- **Full methodology publication:** The complete TII methodology, including all formulas, thresholds, and data sources, is published and publicly accessible.
- **Mid-season checkpoint:** TII scores are published at the All-Star break, providing teams with a behavioral correction window and the public with transparency into the system's operation.
- **End-of-season final scores:** Published within 14 days of the regular season's conclusion.

#### Appeals Process

- Teams may challenge their TII classification within **14 days** of score publication.
- Appeals are heard by the TII Review Board, with the challenging team presenting counter-evidence.
- The Board issues a ruling within **21 days** of appeal filing.
- Rulings are published publicly with full reasoning.

#### Methodology Updates

- The TII methodology is reviewed every **3 years** by the Review Board in consultation with the Board of Governors.
- Threshold adjustments require a **simple majority** vote of the Review Board.
- Structural methodology changes (adding/removing components, changing weights) require **Board of Governors approval**.

## V. Emerging Talent Pool (ETP) — Ratcheting Systemic Enforcement

The ETP is the framework's league-wide enforcement tool. While the dual lottery penalties (Section IV) address individual team behavior, the ETP addresses systemic competitive collapse — the scenario where tanking incentives have distorted the league beyond what individual penalties can correct.

Critically, the ETP is not a binary switch. It is a **ratchet** — its power scales continuously with the severity of league-wide tanking. This eliminates the moral hazard that would exist under a binary system, where teams might reason "the ETP has already triggered, so the cost of additional tanking is zero."

### Core Mechanism: The ETP as a Lottery Participant

When activated, the ETP functions as its own entity in the NBA Draft Lottery, receiving lottery combinations drawn from the forfeiture pool created by penalized teams. If an ETP combination is drawn during any of the four lottery drawings (picks 1–4), that pick is redirected into a supplemental draft available to top-SP teams.

The ETP does not require a separate drawing, probability gate, or additional randomization mechanism. It participates in the existing lottery infrastructure with its own combination allocation — administered by the same independent auditing firm that runs the standard lottery.

### Activation Tiers & Combination Allocation

The ETP's share of forfeited combinations scales with the severity of league-wide competitive failure:

|Severity Tier|Activation Condition|ETP Pool Share|Green Team Share|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Dormant**|Fewer than 3 teams Orange/Red|0%|100% of forfeitures|
|**Tier 1**|3+ teams Orange or Red|25%|75% of forfeitures|
|**Tier 2**|4+ teams Orange/Red OR 3+ teams Red|40%|60% of forfeitures|
|**Tier 3**|5+ teams Orange/Red OR 4+ teams Red|50%|50% of forfeitures|

**Historical deviation override:** If the BTCA's 20-season baseline analysis shows bottom-tier losing patterns exceeding 2 standard deviations from historical norms, the ETP activates at minimum Tier 1 regardless of how many individual teams are formally classified. This prevents a scenario where widespread marginal manipulation keeps many teams just below Orange while producing league-wide competitive distortion.

### Worked Examples

**Moderate Tanking Year — Tier 1 (3 Red teams at top of lottery)**

Three worst-record teams each classified Red. Each loses 30% of 140 combinations = 42 combinations forfeited per team. Total forfeiture pool: **126 combinations**.

At Tier 1, ETP takes 25%: **~32 ETP combinations** out of 1,000 total. Green teams receive ~94 redistributed combinations.

ETP lottery odds per draw: **3.2%**. Across 4 lottery drawings, there is approximately a **12% chance** at least one top-4 pick is redirected to the supplemental draft.

**Severe Tanking Year — Tier 2 (3 Red teams + 2 Orange teams)**

Three Red teams forfeit 42 combinations each (126 total). Two Orange teams (say, 4th and 7th worst records) forfeit 15% of their combinations: ~19 + ~11 = ~30 combinations. Total forfeiture pool: **~156 combinations**.

At Tier 2, ETP takes 40%: **~62 ETP combinations**. Green teams receive ~94 redistributed combinations.

ETP lottery odds per draw: **6.2%**. Across 4 drawings, approximately a **23% chance** at least one top-4 pick is redirected.

**Catastrophic Tanking Year — Tier 3 (5+ teams flagged, 4 Red)**

Four Red teams and two Orange teams produce a total forfeiture pool of approximately **~195 combinations**.

At Tier 3, ETP takes 50%: **~98 ETP combinations**. Green teams receive ~97 redistributed combinations.

ETP lottery odds per draw: **9.8%**. Across 4 drawings, approximately a **34% chance** at least one top-4 pick is redirected.

### The Ratchet Effect: Why Additional Tanking Becomes Self-Defeating

This design eliminates the critical flaw of binary enforcement systems. Consider the decision calculus for a 4th team contemplating tanking when 3 teams are already Red (Tier 1):

1. **Their own combinations drop 30%** (individual penalty).
2. **They add ~40 more combinations to the forfeiture pool** (increasing ETP's raw material).
3. **They push the league from Tier 1 to Tier 2**, increasing the ETP's allocation share from 25% to 40%.
4. **The compound effect:** More forfeitures × higher ETP share = a dramatically larger ETP presence in the lottery.
5. **Every team already classified Red now faces greater pick-redirection risk** because of team #4's decision.

This creates **social enforcement pressure**. The 3 teams already in Red have every rational incentive to publicly and privately pressure team #4 to compete, because team #4's behavior directly increases _their_ risk of losing a pick. The ratchet turns teams that have already been penalized into advocates against further tanking — an alignment of interests that no binary system produces.

### Cross-Season Recidivist Escalation (Proposed)

_The measures outlined in this subsection are suggestive design proposals intended to encourage outside-the-box thinking about systemic enforcement. They have not been formally modeled through collective bargaining analysis and are presented as starting points for further development — not as finalized policy._

While the within-season ratchet addresses league-wide compounding in real time, it does not explicitly penalize **repeat offenders across seasons**. The SP decay mechanism (Section III) provides organic cross-season compounding — a team that tanked last year enters the new season with depleted SP and no SSL eligibility — but the lottery penalty structure itself resets each year.

A recidivist escalation clause would close this gap by increasing penalties for teams that receive Orange or Red classifications in consecutive seasons:

| Consecutive Seasons at Orange/Red | Combination Reduction | Position Displacement | Additional Consequences |
|---|---|---|---|
| **First offense** (baseline) | Orange: −15% / Red: −30% | Orange: −1 / Red: −2 | Standard ETP contribution |
| **Second consecutive season** | Orange: −25% / Red: −40% | Orange: −2 / Red: −3 | Mandatory front office review by Competition Committee |
| **Third consecutive season** | Orange: −35% / Red: −50% | Orange: −3 / Red: −4 | Automatic investigation trigger + ownership governance review |

**Design rationale:**

1. **Closing the reset loophole.** Without recidivist escalation, a team could absorb the standard 30% reduction as a known cost of doing business year after year. Escalation transforms tanking from a repeatable strategy into a depreciating asset — each successive year costs more.

2. **Preserving first-offense proportionality.** The baseline penalties remain unchanged for teams experiencing their first Red classification. This protects legitimately bad teams that happen to trigger Orange in a single unusual season from disproportionate consequences.

3. **Institutional accountability.** The governance review at the third consecutive offense recognizes that sustained competitive integrity failure is an organizational leadership problem, not merely a roster construction problem. This aligns with the NBA's existing authority over franchise governance.

4. **Interaction with SP decay.** Recidivist escalation and SP decay compound multiplicatively. A team in its second consecutive Red season faces: (a) 40% combination reduction instead of 30%, (b) near-zero SP from the prior tank season (50% decay on already-low SP), (c) continued SSL ineligibility, and (d) increased ETP exposure from the larger forfeiture pool. The cumulative cost structure makes sustained tanking economically irrational even for front offices with long time horizons.

_Open design questions for further development:_

- _Should the recidivist counter reset after a Green season, or require two consecutive Green seasons to reset?_
- _Should Yellow classifications count toward the recidivist counter, or only Orange/Red?_
- _Should the escalation curve be linear or exponential?_
- _How should recidivist status interact with ownership transfers — does the counter follow the franchise or the decision-makers?_

### Supplemental Selection Process

When an ETP combination is drawn in the lottery:

1. **The corresponding pick (1st through 4th)** is redirected from the team that would have received it into the ETP supplemental pool.
2. **Maximum redirection:** No more than **2 picks** can be redirected into the ETP in any single draft. If ETP combinations are drawn for a 3rd pick, the drawing continues with the ETP's remaining combinations removed from the pool.
3. **Supplemental selection order:** Redirected picks are made available to teams ranked in the **top quartile of Stewardship Points (SP)**, ordered by SP ranking. The #1 SP team selects first.
4. **Supplemental picks carry standard rookie scale contract obligations** — receiving teams cannot manipulate these selections for cap advantage.

### Anti-Gaming Provisions

The ETP's design structurally prevents the exploit scenarios that would undermine its legitimacy:

**Provision 1: Red/Orange teams cannot access ETP picks.** Any team classified Orange or Red is categorically ineligible to receive ETP-redirected selections. Since triggering the ETP requires Orange/Red classifications, the teams whose behavior activates the mechanism cannot benefit from it.

**Provision 2: Tainted network exclusion.** The following teams are also ineligible to receive ETP picks in any draft year where the ETP activates:

- Any team that acquired draft assets from a Red-classified team via trade within the **previous 24 months**
- Any team that sent draft assets to a Red-classified team via trade within the **previous 24 months**
- Any team whose front office shares ownership interests with a Red-classified team's ownership group

This prevents indirect collusion — a team cannot arrange trades with a tanking partner designed to position themselves as ETP beneficiaries.

**Provision 3: SSL qualification is independently verified.** ETP access requires top-quartile SP ranking, which is calculated from full-season behavioral data across all four TII components plus the SP's own retention, development, and community metrics. Gaming the SP requires a full season of genuine competitive behavior — the exact behavior the system is designed to encourage.

### Nuclear Deterrent: Collusion Forfeiture

If the TII Review Board determines, through investigation triggered by anomalous BTCA patterns or external evidence, that two or more teams engaged in **deliberate coordination to manipulate TII classifications, ETP activation, or draft asset positioning:**

- All involved teams forfeit **all draft selections** (first and second round) for a period of **3 years**.
- All involved front office personnel are subject to league discipline up to and including lifetime bans.
- Forfeited picks are distributed through the standard ETP supplemental process to top-SP teams.

This penalty is designed to be so catastrophic that no rational front office would risk it. The expected value of any collusion scheme must be negative compared to simply competing honestly — and losing 6 draft picks (3 years × 2 rounds) ensures that it is.

### Design Intent

The ETP exists primarily as a **deterrent through structural risk**, not as a frequently activated mechanism. In a well-functioning league where the individual lottery penalties and SSL incentives are working:

- Most teams will be Green or Yellow.
- The BTCA threshold will not be reached.
- The ETP will remain dormant, with 100% of any forfeitures flowing to Green teams.

The ETP's value is in its _existence_ and its _scalability_. Front offices must account not only for the possibility of systemic enforcement, but for the fact that their individual decision to tank makes the enforcement more severe for everyone — including themselves. This is analogous to pollution externalities: the cost of your behavior is not borne solely by you, and the regulatory framework ensures you internalize that externality.

### Fully Algorithmic Execution

- ETP tier determination is entirely algorithmic based on published classification counts and BTCA thresholds.
- Combination allocation to the ETP pool follows the published tier table with no discretionary adjustment.
- The ETP participates in the standard lottery drawing administered by the same independent auditing firm (currently Ernst & Young) that runs the existing lottery.
- No human discretion exists in the activation, tier determination, or pick-redirection process. The only human judgment in the ETP system is the TII Review Board's role in collusion investigations, which is governed by the appeals and governance framework in Section IV.

## VI. Behavioral Outcomes

The framework creates a clear incentive matrix where the penalty mechanism varies by lottery position but the strategic calculus always favors integrity:

|Organizational State|Combination Penalty|Position Displacement|SSL Outcome|ETP Exposure|Net Effect|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Worst record + Green TII|None — receives redistributed combinations (share depends on ETP tier)|None|Full SSL eligibility|None — and eligible to receive ETP picks if top-quartile SP|**Best possible outcome:** enhanced draft odds + full SSL rewards + potential supplemental pick|
|Worst record + Yellow TII|None|None|Reduced SSL eligibility|None|Full draft value but diminished supplemental rewards|
|Worst record + Orange TII|−15% combinations (140→119); forfeitures split between ETP pool and Green teams|−1 position (picks 5th→6th if not in top 4)|Ineligible|Contributes to BTCA threshold; forfeitures feed ETP pool|Reduced draft odds + forfeitures strengthen ETP against you|
|Worst record + Red TII|−30% combinations (140→98); forfeitures split between ETP pool and Green teams|−2 positions (picks 5th→7th if not in top 4)|Ineligible|Forfeitures directly grow ETP pool; own pick at risk if ETP combination drawn|Worst record produces ~6th-worst-team odds, ETP combination pool grows with each additional Red team, no SSL rewards|
|11th-worst record + Red TII|−30% combinations (20→14, negligible); forfeitures feed ETP pool|−2 positions (picks 11th→13th)|Ineligible|Contributes to tier escalation; may push league from Tier 1→2|Tangible draft position loss + increases ETP severity for every other penalized team|
|Mid-tier record + Green TII|N/A (not in lottery)|N/A|Full SSL eligibility|None — eligible to receive ETP picks if top-quartile SP|Standard draft position + full SSL rewards + potential supplemental pick|

**The critical takeaways:**

1. **The worst team in the league retains maximum draft value — and gets a small bonus — as long as it demonstrates organizational integrity.** Rebuilding is rewarded, not just tolerated.
    
2. **No lottery position is a safe place to tank from.** Top-of-lottery teams face devastating combination reductions. Outer-edge teams face concrete position displacement. Everyone contributes to the BTCA threshold and feeds the ETP's growing lottery presence.
    
3. **The penalty gap between Green and Red is enormous.** A worst-record Green team could end up with _better_ odds than a worst-record Red team by a margin of 4+ percentage points after redistribution. That's the difference between a 14% shot at #1 and a 10% shot — significant enough to change front office calculations.
    
4. **Each additional team that tanks makes the ETP more dangerous for every team already penalized.** The ratchet creates a negative externality structure: your decision to tank doesn't just hurt you — it increases ETP severity for every other flagged team. This produces social enforcement pressure where penalized teams actively discourage marginal tankers, an alignment of interests no binary system can generate.
    
5. **Green teams benefit on both sides of the ledger.** They receive redistributed combinations (improving their own lottery odds) AND remain eligible to receive ETP-redirected picks (potential supplemental first-round talent). Integrity is doubly rewarded.

## VII. Owner & Media Framing

### For Owners

- **Franchise valuation protection:** Teams competing meaningfully throughout the season sustain higher local engagement, attendance, and regional sports network value.
- **Structural reward for patience:** The SSL creates tangible asset returns for organizations that build through the draft and develop talent rather than pursuing short-term roster manipulation.
- **Reduced reputational risk:** The framework creates a public, transparent mechanism that separates "bad" from "cheating" — protecting rebuilding owners from unfair public criticism while holding manipulative organizations accountable.

### For Media & Broadcast Partners

- **Late-season competitive preservation:** The framework's incentives encourage meaningful basketball through the final weeks of the season, protecting the value of national and regional broadcast windows.
- **Narrative generation:** The SSL, TII scores, and integrity classifications create additional storytelling opportunities and fan engagement hooks.
- **Competitive integrity branding:** The framework supports the NBA's positioning as a league that values genuine competition, strengthening the overall brand for broadcast negotiations.

### For Fans

- **Every game matters:** Even for non-contending teams, the SSL and SP systems create tangible reasons for every game to be played competitively.
- **Transparency:** Public TII scores and published methodologies give fans visibility into organizational behavior.
- **Rewarding loyalty:** Fans of rebuilding teams can take pride in their organization's integrity score rather than feeling complicit in a tanking strategy.

## VIII. Comparative Advantage vs. Current NBA Proposals

The NBA is currently considering several anti-tanking measures. This framework addresses the limitations of each:

|Current NBA Proposal|Limitation|Stewardship Framework Advantage|
|---|---|---|
|Limit pick protections to top-4 or top-14|Only addresses protection-driven tanking, not general tanking|Addresses all forms of organizational manipulation through behavioral measurement|
|No top-4 picks in consecutive years|Punishes legitimately bad teams equally with manipulative ones|Distinguishes between legitimate losing and intentional losing via TII|
|Lock lottery positions after March 1|Creates incentive to tank harder before March 1|Measures behavior across the full season with rolling windows|
|Lottery tournament among bottom teams|Creates perverse incentives (play-in teams may prefer losing to enter tournament)|Rewards integrity throughout the season rather than creating new game-theoretic distortions|
|Increased fines for resting players|Fines are a cost of doing business for wealthy owners ($500K is negligible)|Creates meaningful structural consequences (SSL ineligibility, ETP exposure) that scale beyond financial penalties|
|Restrict deadline trades or impose trade penalties|Punishes legitimate roster management and interferes with CBA-driven rebuilding cycles|Explicitly protects trade activity; measures post-trade _behavior_, not the transaction itself|

### The Structural Root Cause

None of the proposals currently under league consideration address the fundamental question: _why do teams tank?_

The answer is structural. The NBA draft is the only reliable path to star-level talent for small-market and cap-strapped franchises. Free agency favors large markets with lifestyle advantages and maximum cap flexibility. The CBA's max contract structure means that developing a star through the draft is dramatically more cost-effective than acquiring one in free agency. Bird rights, supermax extensions, and early extension eligibility all reward the drafting team with exclusive access to retention tools.

Given these structural realities, tanking is not irrational — it is the economically optimal strategy for a franchise that lacks a path to contention through the trade market or free agency. Blunt restrictions (pick limits, position locks, fines) do not change this calculus. They simply force teams to tank more creatively.

The Stewardship Reform Plan takes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than adding penalties to a system that incentivizes bad behavior, it introduces parallel rewards that make competitive integrity economically rational. The SSL creates tangible asset value for teams that compete with integrity. The SP system ensures that even non-contending teams have structural reasons to put their best product on the floor. The TII distinguishes between teams victimized by bad CBA outcomes and teams exploiting the system — and only the latter faces consequences.
